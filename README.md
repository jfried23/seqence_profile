# sequence_profile
This package contains an assembly of software tools I built to assist DNA cloning and gene-design in synthetic biology workflows.

*****Examples of each application can be found in the "/examples" sub-directory, but I will quickly sumerize the commandline tools included in the main directory that are built upon this package. ****

AlignSeq.py -- demonstrates (protein/DNA) Needleman-Wunsch dynamic programming alignment functionality implemented in python.

Genewiz.py  -- reads DNA sequenceing data generated by Genewiz Inc and identifies open reading frames sequencing that contain a desired sequence.

Gibson.py  -- is a tool for desiging genes / gene inserts using the Gibson fragment assembly method.

NextGenSeq.py -- is a tool for identifying sequencing runs of intrest from Next Generation DNA seuqencers. Filters out sequencing runs that do not contain a gene of intrest.

SeqObject.py -- is a tool for visualizing restriction sites for molecular cloining in DNA sequences. 

SequenceEdit.py -- is a tool for desiging genes with desired mutations for synthetic biology experements.
